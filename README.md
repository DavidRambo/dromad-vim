# Dromad

Dromad is a Vim colorscheme that uses the palette of the excellent science fantasy
roguelike [Caves of Qud].

## Installation

The usual song-and-danceâ€”use the built-in `packages` feature or a plugin
manager of your choosing, e.g. [vim-plug]:

```vim
Plug 'ngscheurich/dromad-vim'
```

## Credits

All credit for the color palette goes to the team at [Freehold Games]. Dromad
was developed using [Colortemplate].

## Roadmap

Dromad is currently optimized for Elixir and Vimscript. Other languages and
plugins I commonly use may be added in the future, such as:

- [] C#
- [] TypeScript/TSX
- [] CSS
- [] nvim-lsp
- [] ALE
- [] lightline.vim
- [] vim-gitgutter

Pull requests are gladly accepted, especially around language/plugin support.
