# Dromad

Dromad is a Vim colorscheme that uses the color palette of the excellent science
fantasy roguelike [Caves of Qud].

## Installation

The usual song-and-dance—use the built-in `packages` feature or a plugin
manager of your choosing, e.g. [vim-plug]:

```vim
Plug 'ngscheurich/dromad-vim'
```

## Credits

All credit for the color palette goes to the team at [Freehold Games], of which I
am in no way affiliated. You can currently purchase Caves of Qud at any of the
following outlets, which I do recommend doing if you’re a fan of the roguelike
genre or of interesting worldbuilding:

- [itch.io](https://freeholdgames.itch.io/cavesofqud)
- [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/333640)
- [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/caves_of_qud)

Dromad was developed using [Colortemplate].

## Roadmap

Dromad is currently optimized for Elixir and Vimscript, but works well for most
filetypes. I might eventually apply special treatment to other languages and
plugins I commonly use, such as:

- [ ] C#
- [ ] TypeScript/TSX
- [ ] CSS
- [ ] nvim-lsp
- [ ] ALE
- [ ] lightline.vim
- [ ] vim-gitgutter
